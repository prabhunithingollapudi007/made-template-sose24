# Project Plan

## Title
Analyzing the Charging Infrastructures for Electric Vehicles in France against the Fuel prices

## Main Question
Is the fuel price in France affecting the number of charging stations for electric vehicles?

## Description

This is an important question to answer as the increasing fuel prices in France are making it more expensive for people to drive cars. This is leading to an increase in the demand for electric vehicles. However, the availability of charging stations for electric vehicles is still limited in France. This project aims to analyze the charging infrastructures for electric vehicles in France against the fuel prices to understand if the fuel price is affecting the number of charging stations for electric vehicles. The analysis will be based on the data available on the charging stations for electric vehicles in France and the fuel prices.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Charging Stations for Electric Vehicles in France
* Metadata URL: https://transport.data.gouv.fr/datasets/fichier-consolide-des-bornes-de-recharge-pour-vehicules-electriques
* Data URL: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/2729b192-40ab-4454-904d-735084dca3a3
* Data Type: CSV 

The dataset contains information about the charging stations for electric vehicles in France. The dataset includes the location of the charging stations, the type of charging stations, the number of charging stations, and the number of charging points.

### Datasource2: Fuel Prices in France

* Metadata URL: https://transport.data.gouv.fr/datasets/prix-des-carburants-en-france-flux-quotidien-1
* Data URL: https://data.economie.gouv.fr/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/prix-carburants-quotidien/exports/csv

The dataset contains information about the fuel prices in France. The dataset includes the location of the fuel stations, the type of fuel stations, the fuel prices, and the date of the fuel prices.


## Issues

### Issue1: Missing Data
The dataset is primarily in French, so tranlation might be needed for some columns.

### Issue2: Data Quality
The data quality of the dataset needs to be checked to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable.

### Issue3: Data merging
The data from the two datasets needs to be merged to analyze the relationship between the charging infrastructures for electric vehicles and the fuel prices.
